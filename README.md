# Object Detection and Tracking on Drone Video Semester Project 2018 Fall

This is the repository of the works of my semester project in EPFL VITA Lab.
The main task of this project is to create a new dataset for vehicle-to-vehicle behavior prediction. Given the videos recorded by drone, I build up the pipeline to extract the trajectories of the vehicles by using object detection model and object tracking algorithm. The presentation slides and report are available here.
